                        Games Wiki is a project dedicated to creating a unique space for
                        gamers, allowing them to record and share their experiences with the
                        games they love. Our platform was developed with the aim of
                        providing a personal library where each user can curate and document
                        their journeys in the world of video games, from the most popular
                        titles to the forgotten classics. <br/>This project is the result of a
                        learning and experimentation effort, focused on improving web
                        development and design skills. Games Wiki is a non-profit
                        initiative, created solely for educational purposes. We believe that
                        a passion for gaming and the exchange of experiences are essential
                        to the gaming community, and we want to offer a platform that
                        reflects this spirit. <br/> Thank you for visiting Games Wiki, and we hope
                        you enjoy your experience with us. Letâ€™s explore the world of games
                        together!
